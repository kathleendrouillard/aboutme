# Kathleen Drouillard: About Me
My name is Kathleen Drouillard and I am nineteen years of age. My birthday is the twenty fifth of June, I have a mom and a dad and a sister named Emily who is only a year younger than me. I have a part time job as a cashier at Shoppers Drug Mart that I actually like a lot. I like to watch reality television shows and read spoken word poetry. I also have a dog named Moose and a cat named Monkey.
